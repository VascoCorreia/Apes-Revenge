My second game developed! Developed using Lua scripting languange and the Love2d framework.

In order to play 2 players are necessary, one using the keyboard and another using a controller. The reason I decided to developed Apes Revenge this way is because I wanted the challenge of implementing controller adaptation into the game and making it work in a framework that is not adpated for this (Does not make a lot of sense but my past self wanted the challenge).

**Player Controllers**
